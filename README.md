# BirthdayGreets
This is a very basic but an interesting app build by me using Kotlin,
What one all needs to is just enter the name of the person you want to wish Happy Birthday,
and a greeting Card will be at your Screen. By making this app I learned how to use intent for connecting two activities in an App,
and how to transfer data present in one activity to the other and later using this data.
